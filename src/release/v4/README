The present project is a small library that can be used to price financial derivatives on LÃ©vy-driven assets in both one and two dimensions. It provides the functions to price the basic financial objects, as well as the base structure to easily create new financial objects with few lines of code. As for instructions on how use it, see the file INSTALL.

The following example programs can be found in this folder:
1) test1: B&S framework (only PDE) options are tested in 1 and 2 dimensions, using both transformations price and log-price.
2) test2: Kou, Merton models (PIDE equations) on both price and log-price transformations are tested in 1d and 2d.
3) test3: American options are tested, both in 1d and 2d. B&S and Kou models.
4) test4: SpeedTest for the log-price transofrmation with Kou model, serial vs parallel (1d, 2d)
5) test5: Mesh Refinement, on both 1 (price and log-price transformations) and 2 (only log-price) dimensions, is tested.

In addition, the folder misc includes:
1) profiling: a small test program designed to be used with a profiling tool. CMakeLists can be easily edited (just decomment) to add the '-pg' flag to the compiler and the linker for gprof. 
2) extension_doubling: a small extension of the library using a different error estimation for mesh refinement
3) extension_barrier: a small extension that implements a different type of financiel option, an up&out call.
