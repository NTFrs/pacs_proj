This program is designed to be used with the profiling tool callgrind from valgrind. After building it with make (better if make debug):
valgrind --tool=callgrind ./main_profiling

The file contains the output from callgrind that can be analyzed (for example with KCacheGrind). With a simple edit on the CMakeLists.txt, the flag '-pg' can be added to compiler and linker in the debug target: just decomment the relative instructions.

NOTE: The compiler may produce some warnings since openMP is deactivated.
