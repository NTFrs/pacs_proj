In order to use this library, it is only needed to have the deal.ii library and CMake installed. Since it's mostly templates, it is practically a collection of header files, and thus it does not require an installation. It all comes down to using the provided CMakeLists and setting it as necessary. If file locations are kept the same, there is no need to do anyting besides:

1. get in the folder of interest (for example test1),
2. run the following command:
	cmake .
   or
	cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/deal.ii .
   if the deal.ii library is not in /usr/local.
3. Then:
	make release
4. And to run the program:
	make run

----Building the documentation----

If you have doxygen installed, you can compile the documentation typing:

	doxygen doxy-config

in this main folder.

----Compatibility----
This project has been compiled with gcc48 and gcc49, under Ubuntu, OpenSuse and Mac OS X. Althought we have not tested it, we see no reason why it should not work with gcc47 or clang. The only mandatory feature needed for the compiler is c++11 compatibility.
