In this first program we evaluate the price of some options in the Black&Scholes framework.
We start with a 1d European Put with the Price and Log-Price transformation and then we price a 2d European Call.
Finally we perform a convergence test for a 1d Call and a 2d Put, showing the convergence of the price varying the refinement of the grid and the number of timesteps.
